## **Welcome to my website!**

<p style="font-size: 0.9rem; text-align: justify">I am a Max Weber Fellow at the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/home" target="_blank">European University Institute</a> and a PhD Candidate in Economics at <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/economics/" target="_blank">Trinity College Dublin.</a></p>

<p style="font-size: 0.9rem; text-align: justify">As an applied microeconomist, my research lies at the intersection of political economy, environmental economics, and the economics of crime. I am particularly interested in how criminal organizations are influenced by climate dynamics and how they interact with ecological systems. More broadly, my work explores the determinants of green voting and support for environmental platforms, as well as the underlying drivers of criminal behavior.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.9rem; text-align: justify">During my PhD studies, I visited Columbia University and ENS Lyon. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University and a BSc in Economics, Markets and Institutions from the University of Bologna.</p>
