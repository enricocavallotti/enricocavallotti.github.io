## **Welcome to my website!**
  
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/), where I am also affiliated to the [Trinity Research in Social Sciences (TRiSS)](https://www.tcd.ie/triss/) research centre.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **political economy**, **environmental economics**, and the **economics of organized crime**.

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University and a BSc in Economics, Markets and Institutions from the University of Bologna.

Here you can learn about my research, teaching experience, and have a look at my CV. You can also get in touch by emailing me at [cavalloe@tcd.ie](mailto:cavalloe@tcd.ie) or follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/E_Cavallotti).

I am also founder and co-organizer of the Young Irish Economists Seminar Series (YIESS). Click [here](https://sites.google.com/view/yiess) if you wanna know more and get in touch for the upcoming events.
