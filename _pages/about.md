**Welcome to my website!**  
  
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/). I am also affiliated to the [Trinity Research in Social Sciences (TRiSS)](https://www.tcd.ie/triss/).

My research interests lie in the area of political economy, environmental economics, and the economics of organized crime. In particular, I study how criminal enterprises adapt their business strategies in a changing climate. I also study the determinants of environmentalist voting and preferences, as well as the determinants of hate crimes. 

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a BSc in Economics, Markets and Institutions from the University of Bologna and an MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University.

On this website, you can learn about my research, teaching experience, and have a look at my CV.

You can also get in touch by emailing me at [cavalloe@tcd.ie](mailto:cavalloe@tcd.ie).
