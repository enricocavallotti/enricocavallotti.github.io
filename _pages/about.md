## **Welcome to my website!**
  
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/), where I am also affiliated to the [Trinity Research in Social Sciences (TRiSS)](https://www.tcd.ie/triss/) research centre.

My research interests lie in the area of **political economy**, **environmental economics**, and the economics of organized **crime**.

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University and a BSc in Economics, Markets and Institutions from the University of Bologna.

Here you can learn about my research, teaching experience, and have a look at my CV.

You can also get in touch by emailing me at [cavalloe@tcd.ie](mailto:cavalloe@tcd.ie) or follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/E_Cavallotti).
